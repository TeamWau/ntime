ntime
====

Nanosecond timer for Linux (it may work on other OSes)

Aims to be an ultra-precise timer (like `time`).

Usage: `ntime [-nv] <program> <program args>`

Basically moved from our misc repository to its own. Github suggested the name "yolo-octo-hipster" for this repo, which was too great to avoid using somewhere. 

`#yolo-octo-hipster`
